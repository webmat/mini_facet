MiniFacet
=========

This is a small library to add a few basic niceties to Ruby. It's not meant to 
be all-encompassing and include tons of things like Ruby Facets, however.


Example
=======

    require 'mini\_facet'
    # Will include everything
    # Including piece by piece is coming, but is not yet done
    
    Right now, mini\_facet adds the following:
    Hash#extract
    Hash#split
    Array#count_distinct
    Array#includes_all? #and include_all?
